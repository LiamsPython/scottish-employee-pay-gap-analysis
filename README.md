## Overview

This self-directed project explores the **UK Government's 2023–2024 gender pay gap dataset**, focusing on **Scottish employers** 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 
This project is part of my transition into data analytics, demonstrating my ability to handle real-world datasets, build interactive dashboards, and communicate insights effectively.

## Tools Used

- **Python**  
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data wrangling  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualisations  
- **Streamlit** for interactive dashboard  
- **Git & GitHub** for version control and publishing

---

## Data Cleaning & Preparation

- Filtered over **14,000 employers** to isolate **420 key Scottish employment bodies**
- Dropped rows with missing hourly pay gap data
- Standardised employer names and removed duplicates
- Focused on median and mean hourly pay gaps for comparability

---

## Key Findings

- **Average median pay gap** across the sample was approximately **8.75%**
- Some employers report median pay gaps as high as **52%**, while others are near zero
- Local authorities tend to have a higher median gap than national-level bodies
- Variability suggests targeted intervention may be more effective than blanket policy

## Why This Project Matters!

Gender pay disparity remains a pressing issue. By narrowing the focus geographically to the Scottish employment sector, this analysis helps highlight areas where progress is being made—and where further transparency and improvement are needed.
